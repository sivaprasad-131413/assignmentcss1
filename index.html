            <span class="line1">Css is not necessary</span>
            <span class="line2">Css saves a lot of work</span>
            It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            <span class="line3">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</span>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="text2">CSS can be added to HTML document in3 ways:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li class="space">
            Inline - by using the sytle attribute inside HTML elements.
        </li>
        <li class="space">
            Internal - by using a style element in the head section
        </li>
        <li class="space">
            External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file
        </li>
        <li class="space">
            The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the sytle in external CSS file.
            <span class="line2">However, in this tutorial we will see inline and internal styles,</span>
            because this is easier to demostrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies s style to multiple elements ID, on the other 
        hand, applies the style to a unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by Javascript.
    </p>
    <P>In CSS,selectors are used to target a specific element or a range of elements on a web page.Once an element has been targeted,a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</P>
    <P> There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</P>
